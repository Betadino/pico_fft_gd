# Library with *FFT* functions for the Pico <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="images\file.png">

A lightweight and efficient FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) library for the Raspberry Pi Pico, based on the [KISS FFT](https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft) library by Mark Borgerding.

> [!CAUTION]
> This library is still in an experimental phase. Both [examples](https://github.com/Googool/pico_fft/tree/main/examples) have been tested and are working as intended. Code comments and documentation will be included by release 1.0.0.

## Quickstart ðŸš€

*Instructions for connecting the signal to the Raspberry Pi Pico will be provided here by release 1.0.0.*.

## Examples

See the [examples](https://github.com/Googool/pico_fft/tree/main/examples) folder for sample programs that demonstrates how to use this library.
